## Details

The stock chart rails app will have a drop down that will show all available stock tickers. 

When a stock is chosen from the dropdown, the stock chart rails app will show a line chart of the stock prices for each day for a given stock over a period of 30 days in a chart.

Create 4 different stocks and 30 days of data for each stock. If you wish, some days can have missing data. 

Note: when a stock is selected from the drop down, the page should not reload. This is a necessary requirement.
